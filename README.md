## Installation

The setup just involves replacing and adding files with the provided ones:

Replace existing files:

- /etc/ubiquity/env.sh
- /usr/sbin/magni-base
- /etc/systemd/system/roscore.service
- /etc/systemd/system/magni-base.service

        
Add files:
- /usr/sbin/roscore

The magni-base and magni-base.service may not need to be replaced, but it may be a good idea to do it anyway just in case.
