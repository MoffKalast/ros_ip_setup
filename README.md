## Installation

The setup just involves replacing and adding files with the provided ones:

Replace existing files:

- /etc/ubiquity/env.sh
- /usr/sbin/magni-base
- /etc/systemd/system/roscore.service
- /etc/systemd/system/magni-base.service

        
Add files:
- /usr/sbin/roscore

The /usr/sbin/magni-base file may not need to be replaced, that needs testing.
